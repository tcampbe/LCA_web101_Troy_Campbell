          <h2>Family</h2>
          <p>The family is the root of excellence.</p>
          <hr>
          <p>The beginning of my ancestral family is in tribes and clans.  I have Scotch, Irish and Celtic ancestry on the Campbell side. I and my children will soon be registered members of the Cherokee Nation like my Mother and her Mother.</p>
          <pre></pre>
          <p>My earliest family memory is my great grandfather, known as “Rosy”, sneaking me candy from his shirt pocket while his daughter in law, my grandmother, wasn’t looking.</p>
          <p>My Maternal Grandfather served in WWII in the south pacific as a Marine. He was the toughest and most caring man I have ever known. He is my first and primary hero.</p>
          <p>My parents were small town Baptists. My father served in Vietnam and then as a firefighter. He was taken by cancer when I was a young adult. Meningioma caused from exposure to chemicals, likely in a fire, but possibly agent orange. My mother has been a homemaker, book binder, nurse’s aide, restaurant and clothing store owner and retiree extraordinaire. She is much like her father and I love her for it.</p>
          <p>My little brother is smarter, better looking, and thinner than me. I love him but, we will not speak of him much.</p>
          <p>My wife is my ballast. She keeps me even keeled, even headed, and true. She has always been my better half and has become my best of everything. We are one in home and heart.</p>
          <p>I have three sons. One, slender and sharp, sharp of mind and cutting of wit. One deeply feeling, heart on his sleeve, rock solid, and strong. One like me, poor boy, class clown, lover of silliness and devoted to his family.</p>
          <p>I also have family with no blood relations. Friends from work, school, the military and life in general, who are as close as a brother and as loyal as a twin. These people are those whom I have chosen and who in return have chosen me. They hold a special place in my heart</p>
          <p>You might qualify. Let’s find out together.</p>
